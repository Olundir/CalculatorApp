### Project done as part of the FrontEnd Mentor Challanges

## Focus of this project:

- Adding the theme toggle that saves in browser
- clean logic behind calculating the numbers
- responsive design based on ":root font-size" (just trying things out)

### Notes:

- theme switch:
  click to change 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1
  states?
- tiles:
  - top one animates downwards (covers the "shadow"/ bottom side of "3d" cube) on a click (visual 3d effect)
